\chapter{Introduction}
In today’s world, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are one of the leading causes of mortality, claiming millions of lives every year. Early detection and timely monitoring of heart health are crucial for managing these conditions effectively. However, in many rural and remote areas, access to advanced healthcare facilities is limited, leaving a significant portion of the population at risk of undiagnosed heart conditions. 

Imagine a scenario: A middle-aged farmer working in a rural area experiences occasional chest discomfort but dismisses it due to lack of access to medical facilities. One day, he suffers a major heart event because his condition went undetected for years. This is not just an isolated case but a recurring reality in underserved regions. What if there was a device that could have detected his heart condition earlier, allowing timely intervention?  

Electrocardiography (ECG) is an indispensable tool for diagnosing cardiac conditions by analyzing the heart's electrical activity. However, conventional ECG systems—often multi-lead, hospital-grade machines—pose barriers in rural and low-resource settings due to high costs, bulkiness, and the requirement for trained personnel.

Our project - \textbf{Micro-ECG} aims to eliminate these limitations by offering a fully portable, battery-powered, single-lead ECG system that uses:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A WiFi-based microcontroller (ESP8266) for communication.
    \item A real-time, browser-based user interface via captive portal.
    \item Hardware-level noise suppression using op-amps and RC filters.
    \item Frontend ECG signal filtering using hand-crafted JavaScript code.
\end{itemize}

Unlike Bluetooth-based systems or mobile apps, Micro-ECG works independently across devices, requiring only a browser to operate. With both on-device and external chest electrodes, it captures and visualizes cardiac signals accurately.






\chapter{Background}
The heart generates electrical impulses via the sinoatrial (SA) node, which propagate through the atria, AV node, and ventricles. This electrical conduction results in waveform patterns—P wave, QRS complex, and T wave—which an ECG captures.

    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/pqrst.jpg}
    \caption{Normal ECG signal pattern with signal points}
    \label{fig:pqrst}
\end{figure}

Traditional 12-lead ECG machines provide comprehensive cardiac information but:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Are expensive (INR 20,000+).
    \item Require hospital-grade calibration.
    \item Depend on skilled interpretation.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/hospital_ecg.jpg}
    \caption{Traditional Hospital ECG Machine}
    \label{fig:hospital_ecg}
\end{figure}

For early detection, especially of rhythm abnormalities like bradycardia or tachycardia, a single-lead solution is sufficient. This makes the single-lead ECG valuable for first-line screening, community health workers, and telemedicine.

\section{Signal Characteristics}
Typical ECG voltages are 0.5–3 mV, requiring careful amplification. The AD8232 amplifies these small signals to ~1V peak-to-peak for easy sampling by the 10-bit ADC of the ESP8266.

\section{ADC Considerations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ESP8266 ADC reads 0–1V with 10-bit resolution.
    \item An external voltage divider biases the analog input to ~0.5V baseline (AC-coupled).
    \item The effective resolution is $\frac{1V}{1024} \approx 0.976mV$ per ADC step.
\end{itemize}

\section{Filtering Pipeline}
\textbf{Hardware Filtering:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item High-pass (0.5 Hz) to eliminate baseline wander (from respiration).

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Frontend JS Filtering:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rolling average (N = 5 to 10 samples).
    % \item Optional digital IIR high-pass to stabilize drift.
\end{itemize}

\section{Noise Sources Addressed}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Power Line Noise:} Minimized by RC filter + good PCB routing.
    \item \textbf{Motion Artifact:} Reduced via chest electrodes and tight contact.
    % \item \textbf{EMI:} Shielded wiring and star grounding reduce interference.
\end{itemize}
